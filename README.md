# Turn-Down-for-What

Project made with academic purposes for the Visual Computing lecture of the course M.Sc. Interactive Digital Media at Trinity College Dublin to demonstrate my knowledges in video processing. The project is a face recognition that places the 'Turn Down for What' glasses in the captured faces.
About the program:
 - 3 libraries: opencv, video and java.awt.
 - One PImage
 - Array of faces
 - for loop to recognize one or more faces in the array of faces and apply the filtering image
